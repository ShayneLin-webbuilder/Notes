// Program 1: hello.cpp This part of the assignment needs you to write a program
//  that prints out two lines on the display, and nothing else. Remember that 
//  newlines, spaces, and tabs are characters. The output should look exactly as 
//  follows (no spaces before or after each line, except the 2 newlines):

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    cout << "I am ready for cs16!" << endl;

    return 0;
}
